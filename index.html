             My husband and I have spent the last 6 years on a continuous adventure traversing the United States and Canada as truckers.  Even though occasionally our dispachers would remind us that they are not our travel agents, it is precisely how we thought of them because we were able to see and explore this vast and amazing country while delivering goods to various companies.   
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
            Our passion is to travel and see the country and also the world. Because our trucking jobs couldn't take us everywhere, we used our vacation time in the Florida Keys, New York City, Paris, Monaco, the French Riviera, and Jamaica, just to name a few. Our next adventure, we decided, needed to be Hawaii. But we weren't interested in visiting for a only week. We decided to move there. 
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
              So much beauty to explore. Paradise needs to be savored slowly.  We are currently living in Hawaii, and what an amazing place to be during covid-19. The whole island is under quarantine.  All the tourists are gone and the island is now being enjoyed exclusively by the residents. It's never been this way before and it'll probably never be this way again. Whew! We got here in the nick of time!
